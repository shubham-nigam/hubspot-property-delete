# HubSpot Property Cleanup

## Overview

This repository contains scripts to clean up unwanted properties in a HubSpot sandbox environment. It addresses the issue where all object definitions and properties were accidentally synced from the production portal to the sandbox, resulting in cluttered data.

## Problem Statement

Accidentally syncing all object definitions and properties to the sandbox environment led to data clutter and management challenges. The Property Insights feature in HubSpot did not support bulk deletion, necessitating the use of custom scripts to clean up the unwanted properties.

## Solution

The solution involves using the HubSpot API to filter and archive unwanted properties based on their creation date and user ID. This repository contains the scripts and instructions to automate this cleanup process.

## Contents

- `cleanup_script.py`: Python script to filter and archive unwanted properties using the HubSpot API.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the script.
- `README.md`: Instructions and documentation for using the cleanup script.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure API Key**: Obtain your HubSpot API key and update it in the `cleanup_script.py` file.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by running:
   ```
   python cleanup_script.py
   ```

4. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: The script will prompt you to confirm the deletion of unwanted properties. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed.
